        <h1>Who am I?</h1>
        <p>Hi! I'm Pablo, a Spanish data scientist living in Rome (Italy).</p>
        <p>Since my childhood, I have always liked maths and physics. After school, I opted for a Bachelor’s and a Master’s degree in <strong>Aerospace Engineering</strong> in Madrid.</p>
        <p>When doing my thesis in the Department of Mathematics, I discovered what Machine Learning was and all its potential. Since then, I have always worked as a <strong>Data Scientist</strong> from Rome. I will not be exhaustive here, as you can have a look at my LinkedIn profile for further details. Here is a summary:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>I did an internship in a consulting company.</li>
          <li>I worked for G-Evolution, a telematics startup, for three years</li>
          <li>I tried to develop an app, Lingua Ignis, where  users could learn languages from contents chosen by themselves and connect with people with similar interests. The idea didn’t work, but I learnt a lot from that experience.</li>
          <li>Last year, I joined Houseplus, a small Proptech startup in a very early stage, where I have developed and managed any system related to data.</li>
          <li>Very soon, I will work part-time as a teacher in a course of Data Analytics.</li>
        </ul>
          <p> Having worked for small startups and lacking a direct supervisor for most of my career, I am used to learning on my own, managing projects and cooperating with other team members with different roles.</p>
        <p>Over time, I am becoming interested in <strong>Data Engineering</strong> and in general <strong>Computer Science</strong>.</p>
        <p>I also like economics and humanities. In particular, I love learning (and teaching) <strong>languages</strong>. I have worked as a text translator, have taught Spanish and I volunteer weekly teaching Italian to refugees in my local parish.</p>
